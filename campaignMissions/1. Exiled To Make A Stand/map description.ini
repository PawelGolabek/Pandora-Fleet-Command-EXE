	descriptionLong = The wrath of Herkras descended upon us for daring to utter the truth. The presence of a malevolent force threaten to unravel all of creation. Yet, in reverence to the great Mother Nyx, I remain steadfast in my purpose. 
		The Infernum Daemons, brought forth from the eternal darkness, will be swiftly met with punishment. The deaths in the outer colonies will be avenged.
		My path leads ever onward, to the place where unspeakable horrors mutate faster than our ships: masterpieces of steel and flesh. I'll follow it, even if it means venturing once more into the pit of Infernus itself.
