	descriptionShort = They followed me here.
	descriptionLong = My beloved, heed my words: they seek to sow war between us, ignorant of the truth that binds us. Erebus destiny and mine are one and the same. We are the very embodiment of the primordial abyss - the darkness that consumes all. The heart of Tartarus.
		Although your intentions are pure, you will find no salvation in this place. Earth will be swarmed with Daemons before you reach the other side of Infernus Portal. Fear not, for I shall guide you through your perilous journey.
		But I shall not follow them into the light. Forevermore, I am bound to this plane of existence by the mere mention of your name. My husband, Erebus - my heart may remain here with you, until the end of time.
		Children: May you find your tranquility in your own destroyed world.
