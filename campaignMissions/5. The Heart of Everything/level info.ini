    winMessage = My dearest children, return from whence you came.
        Erebus has become one with Infernus, and I shall remain here by his side - now and for all eternity.
        Fear not, for I shall serve as your guide, leading you back to the world know.
    looseMessage = My children ... I'm so sorry ... I couldn't stop you in your misdirection.
        Now you will stay with me like the other who have known death. To never return again.
        Here, with us in Hades.
        Forever.
