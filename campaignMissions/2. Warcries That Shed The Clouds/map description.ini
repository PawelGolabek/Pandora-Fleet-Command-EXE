	descriptionLong = The reopening of the transdimensional portal was a harbinger of the impending cataclysm. 
		Was it the hand of the Goddess of Dark that had rent the veil of reality, or had the once venerated Father succeeded in breaking through the fabric of space and time? Hemera stands steadfastly by my side. Her unwavering resolve shines brightly in the face of the oncoming darkness. Together, our might would dispel the shadows that shrouded the depths of Tartarus.
		As we delved deeper into the chasm, the cunning Daemons increased their resistance. Our blades were raised high as we marched towards the inevitable confrontation. 
		The fate hung in the balance as the dawn approached, ready to dispel the shadows of Acheron with its radiant light.
